# Day 35 - Weather Alert Program (Telegram)

## Overview
This is a simple **Weather Alert Program** created for Day 35 of the 100 Days of Code challenge.  
It checks the weather and sends alerts **directly to a Telegram bot**, which sends messages **only to the owner (yourself)**.  

Unlike previous projects that used Twilio, this project uses **Telegram** because Twilio may not work in some regions.
